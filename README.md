# Python Algorithm Implementations

A collection of different algorithms and data structures implemented using Python

## Makefile

In this repository, you will find a `Makefile` that contains all the necessary imports to run these algorithms

In your terminal run:
```
make environment
```

To activate the environment, enter the following in your terminal:
```
conda activate scientific-python
```

## Sorting Algorithms

In the `Sorting.ipynb` you will find a Jupyter notebook containing sorting algorithms for Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.
